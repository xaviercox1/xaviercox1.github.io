      Microcosm invites its audience to exist within a fabricated digital habitat,
      reminiscent of microbiology. Through organic and ever-changing structures,
      viewers are placed at a molecular point of view, observing life as it might
      appear beneath an impossible microscope.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal" data-delay="260">
      The work encourages the audience to consider how these same patterns and
      landscapes exist all around and within us; they simply remain unseen at this
      scale. The simulation acts as a speculative microscope, submarining into the
      deepest depths of life to reveal a digital ecosystem that feels simultaneously
      artificial and alive.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal" data-delay="380">
      At its core, Microcosm explores how digital systems can mimic organic life
      through generative design. My central question throughout this project was:
      what makes something feel alive? Rather than representing life directly, I set
      out to build a system that behaves as though it possesses its own internal
      logic, something that grows, reacts, and evolves over time.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal" data-delay="500">
      This project builds on my ongoing exploration of the boundary between digital
      and organic systems. By blurring those boundaries, Microcosm aims to create an
      experience that is both futuristic and familiar, a reflection on the hidden
      ecologies that connect code, matter, and perception.
