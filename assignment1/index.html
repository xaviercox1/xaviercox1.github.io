                ANSWER
                <figure class="answer">The cohesive comical design really stood out to me. Corresponding with all of the animations that are utilised in the design, the theme of the website is humorous and playful, yet professional in its approach. The colours are vibrant and draw the eye across the entire page.

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">I began with first looking at the stylistic elements of the design. I scrolled down the webpage and engaged with each bracket of information. When my mouse hovered over different panels, the panels would change and reveal more information about the topic. It also allowed me the ability to click on each artwork and it would provide me with more information.

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Observing the interesting vector artworks. The ones I like the most are the ones which have small animations. The look of each design drew my attention and subtly directed me to click on each of the links. I liked that the visuals matched well with the description.

          <figure class="card">
              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Scrolling was the most common action whilst exploring the website as I had to physically navigate across the website without their being a navigation menu. Although this could be seen as a bad trait, I think that scrolling allows the user to visibly see there is a lot of content.

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">My impression of the intended primary goal would be that Min is showcasing his range of different works which he has completed in his career. Here, Min is utilising style and aesthetics to draw the user across the page and engage with each individual tile.

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Min communicates this goal by introducing himself at the top of the page.

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Min creates a punchy, to the point website to showcase his work. He makes sure to showcase a range of designs in one page so that at first view, users can receive an overall grasp of his skills. Yet, having all the works as links to a more in depth description, it could be assumed he intends on a second, more detailed viewing.</figure>

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Min communicates that this could be interacted with over time by providing dates of when his works have been completed. This indicates that it is continuously being updated and that a user could return a few months later and see what he has created more recently.

              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">As Min creates a website which feels fun and lighthearted, I am enticed to feel more open-minded and forward thinking in my design approach. Here, I am inspired to utilise a range of different skills from my creative history, and learn how to implement these into a website.

          <figure class="card">
              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Although I am not inherently frustrated when viewing the website. I think that Min could have benefited from having a navigation menu. On a second viewing, it might make it easier to skip to certain time points in his career and view these more efficiently. Having this nav menu on each separate page would also allow the user to jump between works more easily.

          <figure class="card">
              ANSWER
              <figure class="answer">Mins ability to have such a coherent design is immensely satisfying to me. The simple comic style design pairs well with minimal animations. The lack of transitions in this case works well and reduces the over-stimulation some websites that are littered with animations can sometimes provide.
