      Welcome to Interactive Media 1! Interactive Media 1 is about enabling you
      to engage with the fundamentals of interaction design through the use of
      web programming. Our focus will be on building up from the basic
      principles of programming, covering the standard web languages - HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript, in order to be able to select and use appropriate
      programming languages, together with core concepts of interaction design,
      in service of your broader digital design goals. Course-Specific Learning
      Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, you will have a comprehensive
      understanding of the key concepts of interactivity, user experience
      design, and information architecture in web-based environments. You will
      also be able to identify and utilize the appropriate technologies to
      address interactive design challenges. Furthermore, you will have the
      skills to analyze user needs, organize information, and create effective
      navigation strategies. Additionally, you will be proficient in controlling
      the visual aspects of typography, color, and layouts through scripting
      languages and coding, ensuring compatibility across multiple platforms.
      Lastly, you will be able to critically evaluate web projects based on
      user-centered design principles.
